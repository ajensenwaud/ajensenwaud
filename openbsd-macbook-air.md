# Context
I have an old MacBook Air 2013 lying around doing nothing, so I thought I would put it to work. It has 8 GB RAM and an Intel Core i5-4250 CPU at 1.30 GHz. MacOS is no longer supported on this old machine, so I thought it might be a good opportunity to put OpenBSD on it to bring it to life!

Unfortunately the laptop's wifi NIC was no longer working, so I had to install and external one. I googled around a bit and worked out that the TP-LINK TL-WN821N (urtwn) based on the RealTek RTL8192EU chipset is a good fit. It only cost about USD 10 on Amazon to order and luckily arrived the next day.
